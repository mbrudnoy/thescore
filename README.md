## Pre-requisites 

1). Download [Chromedriver](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.21/) for Mac and make sure the folder you extract it into is in your $PATH variable

2). Download [MVN 3.3.9](http://apache.mirror.gtcomm.net//maven/maven-3/3.3.9/binaries/) and make sure the path to it is also in your $PATH variable


## Usage


1). Save the master repo as a zip to your local machine, and extract its content. 

2). In a shell, go to the project's root folder and execute the command 'mvn test'. NOTE: This may take up to 30 minutes if you've never had Maven on your machine as it will have to download all dependencies.
